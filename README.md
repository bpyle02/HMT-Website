# HMT-23-24

## Table of Contents
1. HMT Website with Login and Signup
    - This folder houses the full HMT website including the navigation bar, login page, signup page, database, and password/email reset pages
    - It was determined that these features and files would not be needed as the login and signup features will be implemented directly into the GoDaddy website rather than into our actual Julia code. Therefore, these files are here only for reference unless plans changed and they are needed in the future
2. HMT Website
    - This folder contains the full HMT website without nav bar and various account pages mentioned above. This is the final product of the capstone project that will be published to the Vagus, LLC website
3. Hello World Projects
    - This is a collection of each person's hello world project from the first semester to show that we know how to create a simple web server with Julia
4. Reference Files
    - This folder contains Carson's original HMT website code, the mockups of the website from the first semester, a CSV file that is used for testing the website's functionality, and a markdown file with a list of websites we found useful over the course of this project
